            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy current project is to improve my Texas Hold'em hand generator program. Although I initially planned the program to only generate Texas Hold'em hands and board, I saw room for improvement; I am working on an algorithm that would indicate which player is holding the best hand based on the board.</p>
